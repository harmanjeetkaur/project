A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/ccrch/pen/raGVeL.

 Kind of a draft I'm gonna utilize in upcoming project. 3 slides showing one after another in 5s interval. Hover the text to pause progress, click the inactive element to switch that slide, click on the active will trigger some other action (show expanded content).

GSAP FTW!
